    <h2 style="text-align: center">Status: Alpha</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center">This is a tool to make alt text easier.</h3>
    <p>
        I write a lot of alt text, and it's always struck me how useless the user interface offered by every social
        media site is. I wanted to build the composer I wished they had. This is a start. It's going to get even better.
    </p>
    <p>
        What it is not, is accessible. Yet. I am an inexperienced frontend developer, and the ingredients of a
        modern website have inaccessibility baked in. I tried to find help pre-alpha, but had no luck, and decided that
        a limited release was the most likely path to folks gaining interest in the project. An alpha release means it
        works for the author(s), a beta has to work for everyone that wants in, and we won't go live until it's as open
        as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what is it? It's a site offering a set of tools, a small set right now, designed to make writing and saving
        alt text easier. A short list:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An archive of all the descriptions you write with it, searchable by text or image</li>
        <li>
            Optical Character Recognition (OCR) turned up to the next level. The ability to pre-select which areas of
            the image to extract from. 100+ languages supported.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unicode-aware split-on-whitespace for limited character counts, except you can go back and edit the whole
            description.
        </li>
        <li>Generation of localized "Additional Alt Text" images if needed</li>
        <li>It's a static site, and no data leaves your computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Pouring this foundation opens up a place to build more advanced tools, and I want to do everything I can to
        make the web more accessible. The roadmap includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessibility. This is a tool for everyone.</li>
        <li>Browser extensions. Use this tool inline on any site.</li>
        <li>
            Archive in the extensions can save the images alongside the alt text. Search your image library based on
            its alt text.
        </li>
        <li>Integration with social media where possible. Streamline the process of posting with alt text</li>
        <li>Undo support</li>
        <li>
            Advanced user configurable filters for processing the sometimes messy output of Tesseract, with a spot to
            share them
        </li>
        <li>Ability to import/export your archive</li>
        <li>An ecosystem for plugins</li>
        <li>In-page guidance for writing quality alt text</li>
        <li>Support for PDFs</li>
        <li>Ability to tag your descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is an alpha release, things are going to break. I hope those that are able will play with it and give me
        feedback on <a href="https://github.com/alt-text-org/my.alt-text.org">GitHub</a> or
        <a href="https://social.alt-text.org/@hannah">Mastodon</a>
